# NAME

prise - terminal multiplexer

# SYNOPSIS

**prise** [*command*] [*options*]

# DESCRIPTION

Prise is a terminal multiplexer targeted at modern terminals. It allows multiple
terminal sessions to run within a single window, with support for splitting,
tabs, and session persistence.

Prise uses a client-server architecture. The server manages PTY sessions and
persists them across client connections. Clients connect to render the UI and
handle input.

# COMMANDS

Running **prise** with no command starts the client and connects to an existing
server.

## serve

can connect. See **prise**(7) for service configuration.
